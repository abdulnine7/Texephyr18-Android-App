                "For those of us, who are tired of straightforward algorithms- put on your thinking hats, and come up with all the bizarre and uncanny ideas you can think of to accomplish the most common tasks. A CONTRAPTION machine is a deliberately over-engineered machine that performs a very simple task in a very complex fashion, usually including a chain reaction. Instead of just “solving” the problem, team have to make the solution as complicated and as convoluted as possible. So go ahead, break the rules, defy all logic, and make life tougher! \n" +
